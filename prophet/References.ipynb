    "Forecasting is a common data science task that helps organizations with capacity\n",

    "serious challenges associated with producing reliable and high quality forecasts –\n",
    "especially when there are a variety of time series and analysts with expertise in\n",
    "time series modeling are relatively rare. To address these challenges, we describe\n",
    "a practical approach to forecasting “at scale” that combines configurable models\n",
    "with analyst-in-the-loop performance analysis. We propose a modular regression\n",
    "model with interpretable parameters that can be intuitively adjusted by analysts\n",

    "\n",
    "\"I reasoned that in a system that I know admits a profitable trading strategy, because I constructed it that way, can the machine find it. If the answer to that is no, then what chance would it have in the real world where you don't even necessarily know that a profitable strategy exists in the space you are looking at.\n",

    "Abstract. In multi-period trading with realistic market impact, determining\n",
    "the dynamic trading strategy that optimizes expected utility\n",
    "of final wealth is a hard problem. In this paper we show that, with an\n",
    "appropriate choice of the reward function, reinforcement learning techniques\n",
    "(specifically, Q-learning) can successfully handle the risk-averse\n",
    "case. We provide a proof of concept in the form of a simulated market\n",
    "which permits a statistical arbitrage even with trading costs. The\n",
    "Q-learning agent finds and exploits this arbitrage.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "According to neoclassical finance theory, no investor should hold a portfolio\n",
    "(or follow a dynamic trading strategy) that does not maximize expected\n",
    "utility of final wealth, E[u(wT )]. The concave utility function u expresses the\n",
    "investor’s risk aversion, or preference for a less risky portfolio over a more\n",
    "risky one with the same expected return. Only a risk-neutral investor would\n",
    "maximize E[wT ]. The main contribution of this paper is that we show how\n",
    "to handle the risk-averse case in a model-free way using Q-learning. We provide\n",
    "a proof of concept in a controlled numerical simulation which permits\n",
    "an approximate arbitrage, and we verify that the Q-learning agent finds and\n",
    "exploits this arbitrage.\n",
    "It is instructive to consider how this differs from approaches such as\n",
    "Gˆarleanu and Pedersen (2013); to use their approach in practice requires\n",
    "three models: a model of expected returns, a risk model which forecasts\n",
    "the variance, and a (pre-trade) transaction cost model. The methods of\n",
    "Gˆarleanu and Pedersen (2013) provide an explicit solution only when the\n",
    "cost model is quadratic. By contrast, the methods of the present paper can,\n",
    "in principle, be applied without directly estimating any of these three models,\n",
    "or they can be applied in cases where one has an asset return model,\n",
    "but one wishes to use machine learning techniques to infer the cost function\n",
    "and the optimal strategy."
